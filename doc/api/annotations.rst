Annotations
===========

An annotation associates an object such as a note, sound, or movie with a
location on a page of a document, or provides a way to interact with the user by
means of the mouse and keyboard.

Many of the standard annotation types may be displayed in either the open or the
closed state. When closed, they appear on the page in some distinctive form,
such as an icon, a box, or a rubber stamp, depending on the specific annotation
type.  When the user activates the annotation by clicking it, it exhibits its
associated object, such as by opening a pop-up window displaying a text note or
by playing a sound or a movie.
