Trap Network Annotations
========================

A trap network annotation defines the trapping characteristics for a page of a
PDF document. (Trapping is the process of adding marks to a page along color
boundaries to avoid unwanted visual artifacts resulting from mis- registration
of colorants when the page is printed.) A page may have at most one trap network
annotation.  

.. note::

  At the moment libzathura does not offer any further trapping support.
