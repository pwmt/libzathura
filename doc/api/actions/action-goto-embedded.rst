Embedded Go-To Actions
======================

An embedded go-to action is similar to a remote go-to action but allows jumping
to or from a document that is embedded in another document file . Embedded files
may be associated with file attachment annotations  or with entries in the name
tree. Embedded files may in turn contain embedded files.
