Choice Fields
=============

A choice field contains several text items, one or more of which may be selected
as the field value. The items may be presented to the user in either of two
forms:

  * A scrollable list box

  * A combo box consisting of a drop-down list optionally accompanied by an
    editable text box in which the user can type a value other than the
    predefined choices
