Button Fields
=============

A button field represents an interactive control on the screen that the user can
manipulate with the mouse. There are three types of button fields:

  * A pushbutton is a purely interactive control that responds immediately to
    user input without retaining a permanent value.

  * A check box toggles between two states, on and off.

  * Radio button fields contain a set of related buttons that can each be on or
    off. Typically, at most one radio button in a set may be on at any given
    time, and selecting any one of the buttons automatically deselects all the
    others.
