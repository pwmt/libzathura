Contributing
============

Development is coordinated entirely via the `issue tracker
<https://bugs.pwmt.org>`_, our `IRC channel <irc://irc.oftc.net/#pwmt>`_ and our
`mailing list <https://lists.pwmt.org>`_. You can send patches to libzathura's
mailing list but we prefer pull requests on `github
<https://github.com/pwmt/libzathura>`_ are preferred.

Here are a few more things you should know and check before you send pull
requests:

* Follow our coding standard
* Document your code
* Write test cases for your code
