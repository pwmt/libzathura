Contributing
============

Development is coordinated entirely via the `issue tracker <https://git.pwmt.org>`_ or our `IRC channel <irc://irc.oftc.net/#pwmt>`_.
You can send patches to via email, but pull requests on our `gitlab <https://git.pwmt.org/pwmt/libzathura>`_
or on `github <https://github.com/pwmt/libzathura>`_ are preferred.

Here are a few more things you should know and check before you send pull
requests:

* Follow our coding standard
* Document your code
* Write test cases for your code
