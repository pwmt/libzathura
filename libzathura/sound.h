/**
 * A sound object is a stream containing sample values that define a sound to be
 * played through the computerâ€™s speakers. The Sound entry in a sound annotation
 * or sound action dictionary identifies a sound object representing the sound
 * to be played when the annotation is activated.
 *
 * Since a sound object is a stream, it can contain any of the standard entries
 * common to all streams. In particular, if it contains an @a file entry, the
 * sound is defined in an external file. This sound file must be
 * self-describing, containing all information needed to render the sound; no
 * additional information need be present in the document.
 *
 * If no @a file entry is present, the sound object itself contains the sample data
 * and all other information needed to define the sound.
 *
 * NOTE: Only files are supported at the moment.
